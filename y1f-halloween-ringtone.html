I was making a post about weird shit Time Mom did during Christmas and I decided most of it wasn't all that funny or strange until I remembered about her feelings toward Christmas movies. (FYI I'm NC with Time Mom so I'm all good on advice for now) I thought it deserved it's own post because it's so bizarre.

£25 an hour to look after two little children, I wasn't going to turn that down. It was Halloween night and I had grown out of it, but it didn't stop their parents from going to a Halloween party of their own. I followed Janet upstairs. She whispered as she opened the door to Bobbie's room. "That's Bobbie, he won't cause you any trouble. He sleeps through the night." I squinted to see the boy who lay in almost darkness in the bed.
