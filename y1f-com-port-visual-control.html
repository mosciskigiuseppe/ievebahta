Serial Port Control - Easy to use developer component intended for simplification serial port communication tasks in your projects. So, after a lot of thought, I have decided to open source the general purpose half of my code base. The Github repository is here: https://github.com/DeanRoddey/CIDLib (https://github.com/DeanRoddey/CIDLib) Pushing that 'make public' button was one of the hardest things I've done in a long time. But, ultimately I think it's worth doing. For now, it's just there for people to peruse. There's no docs yet. I needed to get it up there and start working with the remote repository and all that.

# Overview of the Guide DM Development Guides are designed to enhance flavor and mechanics for a more detailed world and player engagement. The devil is in the details as the saying goes, and thus the guides will incorporate lore, background and mechanics that are easy to insert in any campaign. Each guide is designed to work together or individually to help a DM grow their world to the level of detail they wish. The guides could even work in the hands of a player who wants information I finally got a chance to do a complete vs c++ tutorial series for serial com port. You can download the example code at source forge http://sourceforge.net/. Somebody asked for it on twitter, but it's a lot harder to do this kind of longer writeups there, so might as well capture it here (does not help that I lost two almost complete attempts there by a picture paste).
